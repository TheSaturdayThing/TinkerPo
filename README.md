# TinkerPo
Develop program to teach students basics about Arduinos, LED matrices, and coding
Low Level Routines: Create programs without setting something to "high" or "low". Utilizes "enable" or "disable" so we can reverse video. 

Updates:
1. Rastering: Initial code. Developed into Random Blink to explore more coding options. 
2. Random Blink: Created pseudo-random number generator to identify rows and columns to activate LED
3. Fade: Plan to create blinking lights similar to pulse with modulation. (Loop, 0<i<1000, inc by 10). Fade in and out.
4. Binary counter: Works for 3X3 matrix. Need to look into how to use the analog outputs because there aren't enough ports for a full 8x8 matrix. Code currently does not do what I want it to! 
5. Next steps: Neopixels, learning bitmaps
